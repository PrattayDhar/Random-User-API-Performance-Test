# Random-User-API-Performance-Test

## Project Summary
Welcome to the project repository for Load Testing and Performance Analysis. This project focuses on conducting load tests and analyzing the performance of a 
web service. Specifically, we will be performing load testing on the URL https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/users with the goal of determining the actual 
TPS (Transaction Per Second) and identifying the bottleneck or stress test point where the system starts to exhibit a 1% error rate.

## Key Features:
-Load Testing Tools: The project utilizes industry-standard load testing tools such as JMeter or Gatling to simulate the load generated by 120,000 users
on the specified URL.

-Load Test Configuration: The project includes configuration files and scripts to set up and execute the load test, specifying parameters such as the number of
concurrent users, test duration, and request rate.

-Real-Time Monitoring: During the load test, the project incorporates real-time monitoring of system performance metrics like
response time, throughput, and error rate. This allows for immediate analysis of the system's behavior under load.

-Actual TPS Calculation: Using the load testing tools and collected performance data, the project calculates the actual
TPS (Transaction Per Second) achieved during the load test, providing insights into the system's capacity and performance.

-Error Rate Analysis: The project includes analysis mechanisms to identify the bottleneck or stress test point at
which the system starts exhibiting a 1% error rate. This information is crucial for optimizing the system and improving its reliability.

## Technology used:
- JMeter
